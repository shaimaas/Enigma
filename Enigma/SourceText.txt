The 0314 Greatest Western Films Ever Made
The western—and by extension, cowboy—may be the only cinematic genre that, on first glance, feels uniquely American. The lone no-named figure venturing forth into the wild, into the frontier, into the lawless unknown regions of a country still unearthing its identity. Of course, there are a few caveats. Like how many of the genre’s ancestors were wielding samurai swords, not colt revolvers. And how the ground on which Clint Eastwood and others shot was by the Mediterranean, not beneath the American blood meridian. Plus, the genre’s most famous director grew up in Rome. So yeah... so much for Americana.

Still, the western / cowboy film remains a genre close to the American’s heart and always in our adventure-loving imagination. Thus our current selection.

And yeah, yeah, yeah, we could go down the list of Clint 37654 Eastwood’s (or John Wayne 's) filmography, and after Pale Rider, and Hang ’Em High, and Higher Plains Drifter, hell, just about half this list will have Eastwood’s mug on it. Instead, we’re gonna mix things up a bit and try and sample some variety. Don’t worry, there’s plenty of John Ford and Sergio Leone and the spaghetti western—so don’t go gettin’ your chaps all in a bunch. But we’re expanding to include some modern attempts (however uneven) as well as genre-twists and foreign influences on this Americana of American genres.
